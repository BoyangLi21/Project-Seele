"""Apply explicitly approved S20 semantic repair packets.

This tool is intentionally narrow.  It accepts no arbitrary packet, validates
the exact approved packet hashes and source region hashes, then applies only
the block transitions recorded in the reviewed CSV files.  The source
baseline is never opened for writing; callers must provide a fresh copied save.
