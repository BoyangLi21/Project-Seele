# Project SEELE — Third-Party Motion Notices

This file records motion sources evaluated by the external 3D pipeline. Raw
source files and private review renders are not committed to the public mod.
Promotion into a release pack additionally requires a per-clip provenance and
QA record.

Its sample motion files and the separate Environment-aware Motion Matching
dataset are not assumed to inherit the code licence. They require independent
data provenance before use.
