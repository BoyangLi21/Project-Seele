# Project SEELE — three-stage direct-capture ordinary attack R05

Date: 2026-08-27

Status: **three independent raw ACCAD attacks are connected directly to the
active Tiger rig in the isolated Motion Lab; human approval is still required
before any normal-gameplay authority changes**.

## Body-motion contract

The body remains a direct normalized-landmark transfer. There are no authored
body poses, IK correction, physics projection, joint-limit projection, or
smoothing filters. Target limb lengths replace human limb lengths, while each
captured source joint direction and frame timing remains intact.

The three 60 Hz, 81-frame clips are:

| Motion Lab name | Raw source | Source window | Duration |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `ordinary_attack_jab_left` | ACCAD Male2 E1 JabLeft | 18–58 | 1.3333333 s |
| `ordinary_attack_cross_right` | ACCAD Male2 E4 CrossRight | 5–45 | 1.3333333 s |
| `ordinary_attack_hook_right` | ACCAD Male2 E6 HookRight | 16–56 | 1.3333333 s |

These are separate captures, not a mirrored or time-shifted copy. Their
combined resource contains 3 clips, 52 bones, and 243 frames.

## Hand treatment

ACCAD's body landmark files do not contain finger capture. The R05 hand layer
therefore uses the DFKI Hand Motion Embodiment grasp reference (CC BY 4.0) to
hold a compact anatomical fist throughout each strike. It affects only the 28
finger bones already present in the active Tiger rig:

- the four native long digits per hand, including their existing root, tip,
  and distal joints;
- the existing native thumb root and thumb tip on each hand;
- no new digit, thumb segment, or detached mesh is generated.

The body capture is not edited by this layer.

## Measured transfer checks

| Clip | Minimum source/target segment-direction dot | Maximum local 60 Hz step |
|---|---:|---:|
| left jab | 0.999923 | 23.0657° |
| right cross | 0.999923 | 28.5168° |
| right hook | 0.999923 | 20.9038° |

All clips report 52 active bones, 28 native finger bones, zero manual pose
keyframes, and no IK or physics correction.

## Motion Lab review

```mcfunction
/seele motionlab reset
/seele motionlab camera
/seele motionlab demo unit01 stop
/seele motionlab demo unit01 attack_a
/seele motionlab demo unit01 attack_b
/seele motionlab demo unit01 attack_c
/seele motionlab demo unit01 attack_combo
```

- `attack_a`: left jab
- `attack_b`: right cross
- `attack_c`: right hook
- `attack_combo`: jab → cross → hook, repeated for review

These commands select isolated visual review data only. They do not replace
normal gameplay attack authority, collision, damage, or network state.
